## Pyinteraph
We have observed that during the trajectory the lower part of the protein enhances and at the same time the upper part moves too. We wondered if there are some correlations between these fluctuations, we wanted to explore more in detail what kind of interaction occur between the residues involved. 
We adressed this problem by means of Pyinteraph.
